# Explore databases
A **Database** is used to define a central system in which data can be stored and queried. In a simplistic sense, the file system on which files are stored is a kind of database; but when we use the term in a professional data context, we usually mean **a dedicated system for managing data records** rather than files.

## Relational databases
**Relational databases** are commonly used to *store* and *query* `structured` data. The data is stored in *tables* that represent *entities*, such as *customers*, *products*, or *sales orders*. Each *instance* of an *entity* is assigned a **primary key** that uniquely identifies it; and these keys are used to reference the *entity instance* in other tables. For example, a customer's *primary key* can be referenced in a sales order record to indicate which customer placed the order. This use of keys to reference data *entities* enables a relational database to be normalized; which in part means the elimination of duplicate data values so that, for example, the details of an individual customer are stored only once; not for each sales order the customer places. The tables are managed and queried using **Structured Query Language** (SQL), which is based on an ANSI standard, so it's similar across multiple database systems.

## Non-relational databases
**Non-relational** databases are data management systems that donâ€™t apply a relational schema to the data. Non-relational databases are often referred to as **NoSQL database**, even though some support a variant of the SQL language.

There are four common types of **Non-relational** database commonly in use:
* **Key-value** databases in which each record consists of a unique *key* and an associated *value*, which can be in any format.

* **Document** databases, which are a specific form of *key-value* database in which the value is a JSON document (which the system is optimized to parse and query)

* **Column family** databases, which store tabular data comprising *rows* and *columns*, but you can divide the *columns* into groups known as *column-families*. Each column family holds a set of columns that are logically related together.

* **Graph databases**, which store entities as *nodes* with links to define relationships between them.
